data and code from the Naik SH et al, Nature 2013

Data from the paper Naik SH, Nature 2013 doi: 10.1038/nature12013

LMPP and HSC have been labelled with cellular barcodes. Their progenies have been sorted and their barcode analyzed at 10,14 and 28 days. 
The data available here have not been quality filtered. 

The name of the text file are as follow: "name of the experiment type of progenitor time point mouse number "

In the txt files, you''ll a matrix per mouse where:

    the column tag correspond to the identity of the barcodes
    the other columns correspond to the reads per barcode in a given sample. The name of the sample are coded as follow: "day_typeofprogenitor_micenumber_celltype" M or My for myeloid cells E for erythroblasts Dc for dendritic cells B for B cells
